# e-commerce

Overview:

This project was created in an attempt to create the backend of an application for a small business to be able to conduct business online. The app uses SQL, Express, and Node.js.


Challenges: 

This project presented many challenges as a fledgling developer. The biggest challenge was keeping a bird's eye view on the project as I was working on it and not getting to sucked into one particular detail. The second biggest challenge was learning how it all connects. I understand enough to get to this point but to be honest, this seems to be my place to be stuck. The third biggest challenge as always, is the syntax.

How to run:

Go to root directory and use "npm i" to install dependcies. Login with "mysql -u root -p" and "source db/schema.sql" to start creating the tables and then exit and run "npm run seed" and then "npm start"!
